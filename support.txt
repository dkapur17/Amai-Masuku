Frameworks: 
- OpenCV: Used for video processing 
- DarkNet: Used for the YOLOv4 network

Libraries: 
- SciPy: calculating distance between bounding boxes for centroid tracking algorithm
- NumPy: matrix methods 
- imutils: image processing utilities
- argparse: to parse command line arguments 
- tqdm: to display video conversion progress
- cv2: for openCV video handling 

How to run inference 
Execute the command python3 main.py -i <input_file> -o <output_file> -d 0/1 -C <path_to_csv_file> -T <pat_to_text_file>
-i is the flag for the input video file
-o is the flag for the output video file 
-d is the flag for whether the video needs to be rendered frame by frame while the program is running
-C is the flag for path to csv frame statistics file, ensure the directory structure exists
-T is the flag for path to text subject statistics file, ensure the directory structure exists
